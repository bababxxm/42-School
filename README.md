# 🌟 My 42 School Journey

Welcome! I’m **sklaokli**, a student at 42 School, an innovative, peer-driven, and self-paced coding school. My journey at 42 has been focused on developing strong programming fundamentals, mastering C and C++ programming, and exploring web development, networking, and system-level projects. Through a combination of solo and group projects, exams, and hands-on challenges, I have gained practical experience in real-world software development, algorithmic problem-solving, and collaborative coding. This repository serves as a showcase of my 42 School projects, from the intensive Piscine to the Common Core and Advanced Core, providing insight into the skills I have acquired and the projects I have completed along the way.

## 🌐 Environment

42 School is a **peer-driven, self-paced coding school**. Every project is evaluated within a structured environment to ensure learning, skill growth, and code quality.

---

### 📝 Norminette (Coding Standard)
Almost every project must follow the **Norm**, the official coding standard. This ensures **readable, maintainable, and professional code**.

**Key Rules:**
- Maximum **25 lines per function** (excluding braces)
- Maximum **80 characters per line** (including comments)
- Maximum **4 parameters per function**
- Maximum **5 variables per function**
- No forbidden constructs: `for`, `do...while`, `switch`, `case`, `goto`, `ternary operator`
- No assignments on the same line as declaration (unless `const` or `static`)
- Mandatory **function prototypes and headers**

💡 Following the Norm is mandatory for **peer evaluations** and for passing the **Moulinette** checks.

---

### 🤖 Moulinette (Automated Evaluator)
**Moulinette** is 42 School’s automatic grading system.  
It checks your code for:

- Norm compliance ✅
- Correct functionality against project specs 🛠️
- Memory errors and leaks (C projects) 💾
- Output format and edge case handling 📄

**Evaluation Types:**
| Type | Who Evaluates |
| :--- | :----------- |
| Solo project | Moulinette or Peer |
| Group project | Peers, sometimes verified by Moulinette |
| Exams | Moulinette only, time-limited (2–4 hours) |

---

### 📊 Evaluation & Progress
Projects and exams use a **points system** (usually out of 100 or 125).  
Additional details:

- **Peer Evaluations Required:** Some projects need multiple peers to approve before completion.
- **Bonus Points:** Extra features or optimizations can give bonus points.
- **Blackhole Days:** Completing projects can grant extra days to postpone future deadlines.
- **Passing Requirements:** A total number of evaluation points is needed to progress through the Common Core.

💡 **Tip:** Always submit code that passes the Norm and is peer-ready. Peer evaluations can influence your ability to move forward.

---

Understanding **Norm**, submitting projects to **Moulinette**, and completing **peer evaluations** is key to progressing smoothly at 42 School. Projects combine **individual work** with **collaboration**, teaching both technical and soft skills.

---

## PISCINE

The **Piscine** (French for "swimming pool") is a **4-week intensive bootcamp** at 42 School designed to introduce you to programming fundamentals.

- Focused on **C programming**, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking.
- Projects are **solo and hands-on**, emphasizing practical skills over theory.
- Students are **immersed in coding**, often working long hours to complete exercises.
- Goal: Build a strong foundation before tackling more advanced projects in the **Common Core**.

💡 Think of it as the **foundation layer** of your 42 School journey.

---

## COMMON-CORE

After the Piscine, you progress to the **Common Core**, which includes **mandatory and bonus projects** organized by ranks.

- **Rank Structure:** Projects are grouped by rank (e.g., Rank 00 → Rank 06). Each rank usually has **3–5 projects**.
- **Exams:** Each rank may include an **exam project**, evaluated only by the **Moulinette**. Exams test your understanding of the rank’s core concepts.
- **Solo vs. Group:** Some projects are **solo** (e.g., Libft, Pipex), others are **group projects** (e.g., Minishell, Cub3D). Group projects teach collaboration and code integration.
- **Languages & Tools:** Covers **C, C++, Web, Networking, and Docker**, depending on the rank and project.
- **Evaluation:** Each project has a **point grade**, sometimes requires **peer evaluations**, and may grant **bonus points** for extra features.

💡 The **Common Core** is where you **apply the fundamentals from the Piscine to more complex, real-world projects**, gradually increasing in difficulty and scope.
